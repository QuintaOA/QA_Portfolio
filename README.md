In the last 5years at Kenya Revenue Authority, I have conducted thorough testing of assigned modules in the revenue software applications identifying and documenting defects, and collaborating with development teams to ensure timely resolutions leading to overall improvment of the revenue system quality by 40%.I also collaborated closely with developers and product managers to ensure requirements were met.
I believe strong communication is key in testing. I regularly participated in requirement reviews,sprint planning and retrospectives, ensuring that testing was integrated into the requirement stage,development lifecycle and that any issues were addressed promptly.
